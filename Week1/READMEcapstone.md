# Week 1 Homework
## Definition Statement
I want to make a web application that displays our product, allows for feedback on different clothing designs, and allows for customers to submit their own designs.
## Definition of Audience
Our target audience will typically be Gen Z and Gen A. These tend to be the people most interested in graphic design clothing and streetwear. For those who want to look stylish while staying comforatable.
## Outline of Content
Page 1) Our product page. Displays all designs, featured section showing new releases.
Page 2) Customer submission section, display featured customer designs
Page 3) about us, how we started, that path we took to get here, how we wish to grow in the future
Page 4) contact information
- Images – TBD, my partner hasn’t drawn his designs out yet, only has rough sketches.
- Color Palette – [Link to color palette](https://coolors.co/64113f-1b9aaa-dddbcb-f5f1e3-ffffff)
- Logo - Work in progress. We are talking through a few designs but nothing has been finalized yet.
- Navigation – in the header, next to logo. Contains links to all 4 pages

## Research
-	[Website1](https://www.gq.com/story/streetwear-brands-to-know)
o	I like the descriptions of each item
o	Dislike flow of the page, where the info is located
o	I will be presenting the product at the top of the page so it is the first thing the customer see’s
-	[Website2](https://us.shein.com/Men-Ink-Painting-Pattern-Jumper-p-2869569-cat-1975.html?url_from=adplasmsweater25210609020L_GPM&cid=15534601883&setid=&adid=&pf=GOOGLE&gclid=CjwKCAjw586hBhBrEiwAQYEnHTi8t1I5hjk-a3PkZC7oustvJ1EiQ_OZjB0KLFtrKNc4qCBNWWNiKxoCoc8QAvD_BwE)
o	I like their navigation and being able to blow up the size of each image, as well as various angles of each item. Feedback section that allows for images of the clothing on the customer is a great idea to see what their reviews mean
o	Dislike the color palette, the page is very boring
o	Implement different viewing angles on my page
-	[Website3](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/best-japanese-clothing-brands/)
o	I like how the page is clean and simple
o	Dislike how much text is between each image
o	I will create a feature that gives a description of the item after you click on it to view, this way the customer has to do as little scrolling as possible

## SWOT Analysis
### Strengths
-	Product is all in one place, very little space between designs. Allows for easier navigation through items
-	Allows for feedback on new designs
-	Allows for customer submissions and community interaction
### Weaknesses
-	Lack of designs as of now
-	Can’t save items to view later without creating an account
-	Featured section may be stagnant for periods of time until new designs are released
### Opportunities
-	Markets our product before it is created, this will save tremendous amounts of money
-	Customer submissions is a way for us to bring new designs to the brand while also interacting with our customers
-	There is a lot of room for growth. Eventually payment options can be set up, and there is potential that we could turn it into a social media platform of sorts for creators to share their ideas and get feedback,
### Threats
-	The number of fashion startups that have been showing up recently
-	Only one person is designing the clothes for the whole company, could potentially run out of ideas
-	Many other fashion brands are already established while we are starting from scratch
-	Possible copyright infringements when it comes to user submissions. MAKE TERMS AND CONDITIONS
